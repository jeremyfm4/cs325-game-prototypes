<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I created most of the game assets, the story of the game, and the gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game uses different game states when you win or lose, and loops back to the main menu.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learend how to use game states.
The hardest part was figuring out that you have to add the game states to the index for the game to run properly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The code for this game is adapted from a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/making-games-with-phaser/learn/lecture/5159672#overview">Udemy course by Michael Leung</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Shoot down the incoming cats and the lady before the cats eat you.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person with lots and lots of cats
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse
Randomness: Deterministic
Play Styles: 
Genres: Shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is testing shooting bullets at the location where the mouse is clicked on, and tweening back and forth.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience the challenge of weaving bullets between cats in order to hit the lady managing the cats coming at them.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The goal is to hit the lady 5 times with projectiles to defeat her. The player will use the mouse to aim the rat, and they will click on the screen to fire a projectile. The lady will move up and down, and launch cats at the player in a set interval. The player must hit the cats with projectiles to kill them before they kill the rat.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should try to predict where the lady will be a few seconds ahead of time to know where to aim the bullet, and they should try to fire after a cat is launched towards them so that another cat won't block the bullets fired towards the lady.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in the yard of a crazy lady with lots of cats. You play as a mutant rat the spits poison projectiles. One day, the crazy lady  spots the rat and decides it will be the next meal for her cats. The rat is now trapped in a deathmatch against the crazy lady and her many cats.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is anyone who enjoys point and click shooter games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than or around 1 minute.
