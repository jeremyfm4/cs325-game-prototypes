<h2>Escape from Heaven</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I created most of the game assets, the story of the game, and the gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I made a large scale level with lots of tiles and enemies. There are enemies that can patrol, enemies that can shoot bullets. There's a locked door that requires a key to open.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learend a lot about designing and creating a level from scratch.
The hardest part was designing a level that wasn't too hard, but also wasn't too easy.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Every other asset was self-made.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The game that most closely resembles this game is Mario, and any other platformer game.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Avoid angels and traps and try to reach the end of the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Escaping from Heaven.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is test the ability to create a map out of tiles, and test the viability of the different types of enemies that can be created.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience the enjoyment of platformer games, and the excitement of reaching your goal by getting past any danger.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The goal of the game is to reach the door that will bring you back to earth by avoiding any traps and the angels sent to capture you.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should try to watch for incoming bullets, and use the energy barrier accordingly. If there's a locked door then players should look out for a key so they can progress further.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in the outskirts of heaven, where you find yourself trying to escape and return back to earth. Angels have to come to capture you and bring you back, but you're willing to do all you can to go back to the place you call home.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is anyone who likes platformer games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than or around 1 minute.
</li>
